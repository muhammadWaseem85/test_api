GO TO PROJECT REPOSITORY USING TERMINAL ....

Basic Commands:
>>>if you want to run in chrome browser in headless mode
mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=chrome -Dheadless=true

>>>if you want to run in chrome browser 
mvn clean verify -Dbrowser=chrome -Dheadless=false


- Go to terminal a run the below command to test in default browser in headless mode
mvn clean verify
        

### Known problems...

- It looks like SafariDriver is no longer playing nicely and we are waiting on Apple to fix it... Running safari driver locally in server mode and connecting to it like a grid seems to be the workaround.

### Anything else?

You can specify which browser to use by using one of the following switches:

- -Dbrowser=firefox
- -Dbrowser=chrome
- -Dbrowser=ie
- -Dbrowser=edge
- -Dbrowser=opera

If you want to toggle the use of chrome or firefox in headless mode set the headless flag (by default the headless flag is set to true)

- -Dheadless=true
- -Dheadless=false

You don't need to worry about downloading the IEDriverServer, EdgeDriver, ChromeDriver , OperaChromiumDriver, or GeckoDriver binaries, this project will do that for you automatically.

You can specify a grid to connect to where you can choose your browser, browser version and platform:

- -Dremote=true 
- -DseleniumGridURL=http://{username}:{accessKey}@ondemand.saucelabs.com:80/wd/hub 
- -Dplatform=xp 
- -Dbrowser=firefox 
- -DbrowserVersion=44

You can even specify multiple threads (you can do it on a grid as well!):

- -Dthreads=2

You can also specify a proxy to use

- -DproxyEnabled=true
- -DproxyHost=localhost
- -DproxyPort=8080

If the tests fail screenshots will be saved in ${project.basedir}/target/screenshots

If you need to force a binary overwrite you can do:

- -Doverwrite.binaries=true

### It's not working!!!

You have probably got outdated driver binaries, by default they are not overwritten if they already exist to speed things up.  You have two options:

- `mvn clean verify -Doverwrite.binaries=true`
- Delete the `selenium_standalone_binaries` folder in your resources directory
